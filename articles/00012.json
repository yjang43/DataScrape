Typically, it would take her more than an hour to travel from her home in Astoria, Queens to her office at a management consultancy on Wall Street. It involved three modes of transport: a bus to drop off her baby daughter at day-care, then a packed subway carriage into Manhattan\u2019s Financial District and finally a brisk 15-minute walk to the office.\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t fun,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was awful.\u201d\n\nThat was before the Covid-19 stay-at-home order stopped everyone in their tracks. Now, after several weeks of working from home, Loughney admits that she actually misses her commute. \u201cIt\u2019s pitifully sad to say that, but it\u2019s true,\u201d she says. \u201cWorking from home \u2013 for those of us fortunate enough to be still working \u2013 has brought an added layer of stress. [The] need to always be on, to always be working. You\u2019re working through dinner; you\u2019re working after dinner; you\u2019re working after you put your kids down to bed. There is no separation, and the commute provided that mental separation.\u201d"}
