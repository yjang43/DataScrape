A portion of the proceeds will go to support big cats, obviously, but also, first responders, according to the product description.\n\nBig Cat Rescue, Baskin's animal sanctuary in Tampa, Florida, has been closed to the public due to the pandemic. But that hasn't stopped her from providing daily updates to her fans on the sanctuary's Facebook page -- and pushing back against some of the drama."}
