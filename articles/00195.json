Lenny thinks his gift for impressions came from trying to integrate\n\nA young Lenny in 1979\n\nGrowing up in the West Midlands, Lenny faced frequent racism. He describes living in two worlds: at home, he felt Jamaican, but outside his friends were white and he did what they did. Lenny\u2019s skill for mimicry first grew through trying to fit in and talk like everyone else, but later it \u201cbecame this other thing of, well, how does John Wayne talk? How does James Stewart talk? And I can use that to make my friends laugh too.\u201d\n\n5. At first, he kept his talent for comedy hidden from his family\n\n\u201cIn our house, my mum was the funny one,\u201d Lenny says. If he had made wisecracks at home as a child, he knew it would have been seen as cheeky by his parents and resulted in punishment. So instead, he made jokes and did impressions to entertain his friends in the park. For quite a long time, Lenny\u2019s family had no idea he could be funny. \u201cIt was like a little secret I held in my heart,\u201d he says.\n\n6. Lenny\u2019s first gig was as Elvis Presley at a local disco\n\nAlthough Lenny was a shy teenager, his friends pushed him to enter a talent contest. He performed as \u2018wobbly Elvis\u2019, singing Jailhouse Rock. The response, he recalls, was overwhelming: \u201cIt was like the first ever proper round of applause I\u2019d ever received from an audience. I just thought, \u2018That\u2019s brilliant, and how do I get that again?\u2019\u201d\n\n7. He felt deeply conflicted about appearing in The Black and White Minstrel Show\n\nOne of Lenny\u2019s first TV jobs was on The Black and White Minstrel Show. Each week, he would do a short set of jokes and impressions, while the cast of \u2018minstrels\u2019 would perform song and dance numbers, the men wearing blackface. It\u2019s a concept that was already being recognised as offensive. Looking back, Lenny feels his presence was a way for them to say, \u201cHow can we be racist? There\u2019s a black guy in the show.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager new to showbiz, Lenny was told to take the job as an opportunity to learn his trade but being part of the show made him feel \u201cvery lost for a period\u201d. However, it also meant he could provide for his family, so they no longer had to live on the breadline. \u201cI have to not be ashamed of that,\u201d Lenny says. \u201cBecause that was a very, very, very positive thing. No matter how I was doing it, I was able to help my family.\u201d"}
