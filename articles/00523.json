The Department of Health statement said \"it can also affect your sense of taste as the two are closely linked.\"\n\nThe Chief Medical Officers for the four nations of the UK endorsed this expansion of the recognized symptoms, saying they \"have been closely monitoring the emerging data and evidence on Covid-19 and, after thorough consideration ... are now confident enough to recommend this new measure.\"\n\nThe move comes after Tim Spector, the head of the UK's coronavirus symptom tracking app and a professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, criticized the government's failure to expand its list of symptoms."}
