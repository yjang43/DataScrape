In Autumn this year Eliud Kipchoge, with support from INEOS, plans to redefine the limits of human achievement by breaking the last great barrier of modern athletics -- the two-hour marathon.\"\n\nLast week Ratcliffe and INEOS were accused by environmental protesters of \"sportswashing\" -- using sport to enhance reputation -- an accusation the Briton completely rejects.\n\nSpeaking to reporters ahead of cycling's Tour de Yorkshire, Ratcliffe took aim at those who criticized his company's fracking project, claiming the majority of environmental groups he has met are \"ignorant\" of the process, adding it remains a cheap source of energy.\n\nEliud Kipchoge is expected to take part in the event in September or October 2019.\n\nRead More"}
