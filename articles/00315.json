When the coronavirus pandemic forced the city to shut down public spaces, he had an idea.\n\n\"I thought we should go virtual,\" says Rogers. \"I wanted to do it professionally, with a production team that could look into it and see how feasible it was.\n\n\n\nIn just a few weeks, Rogers and the NYUAD Arts Center sourced the technology needed to create an online performance. He set up two virtual poetry nights on social media, with a line-up that included spoken word artists and musicians from around the world."}
