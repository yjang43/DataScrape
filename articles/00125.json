Listen again on BBC Sounds.\n\nGemma is a teaching assistant at a junior school in Hemel Hempstead. She's been going into school anyway, as have her children, and says she\u2019s \"probably more anxious for my own children than I am for myself because they\u2019re going to be around more children\u2026 As a parent you just instinctively worry regardless of what science is telling us\u201d.\n\nSchool governor and teacher Matthew (not his real name) says that not knowing how many pupils will come back is proving challenging.\n\n\u201cInformally, from conversations with colleagues and parents, there are a lot of parents who would be reluctant to send their children back in,\u201d he says, \u201cso you\u2019re looking at potential occupancy of between 40 \u2013 70%. That will add to the workload of schools because we\u2019re having to prepare as though we\u2019ll receive 100% of the pupils on the roster\u201d.\n\nJo is a teacher at a private school but also has two children at primary school, one with underlying health conditions.\n\nShe says she understands people\u2019s concerns but: \u201cWe have to go with the science, and the science suggests it is low risk.\n\n\u201cBeing in school is more than just learning, it\u2019s their mental wellbeing, it\u2019s their social and emotional development. It\u2019s how they're going to be independent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for vulnerable children, but it\u2019s important for all children.\"\n\nShe says she feels \u201cvery cross\u201d about some of the language being used around the debate. \"I feel that is feeding into parents' fear. We have over a week still to get ready and we can do that.\""}
