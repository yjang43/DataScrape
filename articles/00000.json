His children are in Year 4 and Year 6. He is furloughed and says he will not sending his Year 6 child back on 1 June.\n\n\"We feel we can take the pressure off the school a bit by not sending him back in until the school is up and running,\" he says.\n\n\"Having 30 kids go back in and social distancing in a small rural school is going to put massive pressure on.\"\n\nGrace in Lincolnshire, a GP currently on maternity leave, says she's seen \"shaming of parents\" who are just trying to make the right decision for their family. She is sending her five-year-old son back into reception.\n\n\u201cI am at home at the moment so home education has not been a problem but I\u2019ve seen how he\u2019s been affected by being at home for that long. He\u2019s really struggling with it and it\u2019s having quite a big impact,\" she says.\n\n\u201cAlthough school will be different\u2026. I think that\u2019s the best thing for him. It\u2019s better for him to play alongside his friends than to continue being isolated.\"\n\nOther parents highlight the differences in support from schools. James in Coventry is a HGV driver and his wife is working from home. Their son is seven.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had no real contact off the school \u2013 we\u2019ve had a couple of word searches and a couple of small puzzles.\n\n\"If it weren\u2019t for BBC Bitesize then my son\u2019s learning would have been non-existent.\""}
