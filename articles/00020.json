In the early stages of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan, authorities there downplayed its significance. A doctor who sounded the alarm was forced to contradict himself. He later contracted Covid-19 and died from it. Medical facilities were initially unprepared. This and other similar stories led to an explosion of critical comment on Chinese social media, with deep distrust emerging of the official explanations.

The government then began do change tack, instituting wide-ranging and it seems effective restrictions, which have slowed the growth of the epidemic.

In this documentary, Mark Mardell assesses how President Xi and his government will emerge from the crisis. Producer: Cat Farnsworth"}
