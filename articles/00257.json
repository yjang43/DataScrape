He couldn't return it. And you are on it...slapping it for a winner. I couldn't get it past you.\"\n\nKyrgios does own a 2-0 record against Djokovic while losing five of six to the Scot. But Djokovic has won 17 grand slam titles to Murray's three to make him one of the Big Three in men's tennis alongside Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.\n\nWhile Kyrgios and Murray have always gotten along -- even going on a roller coaster ride together in Cincinnati in 2018 -- the world No. 40 hasn't hid his disdain for Djokovic.\n\nJUST WATCHED Time Out: Andy Murray using lockdown to see his kids grow up Replay More Videos ...
