Suzauddin Rubel/AP\n\nA Bangladeshi official has claimed that Cox's Bazar, a series of camps housing nearly one million Rohingya refugees, is prepared for Cyclone Amphan.\n\n\"For the cyclone we are prepared. We have tightened the huts of the refugees,\" Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Md. Mahbub Alam Talukder told CNN.\n\n\"All 32 camps have trained volunteers ready. We have mosques and other learning center[s] if we need to relocate the refugees for safety.\"\n\n\u201cToday the weather was very cloudy and gloomy. The weather is too bad and [we] were not happy with the cyclone,\" Amir Hossain, a Rohingya refugee at the Kutupalong camp, told CNN.\n\n\"If the cyclone hit the camp all the refugees will be in the danger as our huts are weak.\u201d\n\nOfficials at Cox's Bazar were already grappling with the threat of coronavirus before the storm hit.\n\nThe first known Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the camp last week."}
