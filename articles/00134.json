The only thing we're lacking is the air sensor, which we're trying to source rather than build from scratch as it takes time.\n\n\"The first phase is complete and it was tested in a hospital two days ago. The team are working on phase two, which once completed can be introduced to the market.\"\n\nWith a less than 30% female literacy rate in the country, the teenagers hope their project will inspire others and change the perception of women in the engineering industry.\n\n\"It [being able to make ventilators] shows the importance of teaching girls at a young age and the role of women as active citizens in our society,\" says another team member, Elham Mansori, 16.\n\nThe initiative has been welcomed by the Afghan government.\n\n\"I'm glad President Ashraf Ghani has personally ordered the authorities to look into our project and to help us in any way possible\" says Ms Mahboob.\n\nThe Afghan health ministry is supporting the girls.\n\n\"We appreciate their initiative but like any other scientific research, there are phases for it, like discovery and development, pre-clinical research and when it's offered in the market it's analysed and approved,\" Waheed Mayar, spokesperson for the health ministry, told the BBC.\n\n\"Patient safety is our priority so we have to make sure the device is tested on animals in laboratories first before being tried on coronavirus patients.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:"}
