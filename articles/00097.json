They're loved and they want to live.\u201d\n\n\u2018Very deflated\u2019\n\nBrazil now has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world - around a quarter of a million, ,according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut experts suggest the figure could be more than three million.\n\n\u201cI can categorically say that Brazil has become the most important epicentre for the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the world,\u201d Domingos Alves, a professor at the Ribeirao Preto Medical School told BBC News Brasil.\n\nAlmost 18,000 people have died according to official figures, but Prof Alves warns that the death toll has been massively underreported.\n\nAnd yet President Bolsonaro insists that Covid-19 is \u201conly a mild flu\u201d.\n\nThe far-right leader has been attending anti-lockdown demonstrations, shaking hands with supporters, and even promising to hold a barbecue \u201cfor about 30 guests\u201d in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Katy Watson looks at how Bolsonaro has responded to the virus\n\nQuestioned by journalists last month after Brazil\u2019s death toll exceeded 5,000, he said: \u201cSo what? I am sorry, but I can\u2019t work miracles.\"\n\nItalo Lennon, an epidemiologist tracking the pandemic at Cear\u00e1's public health department, says the situation is making him feel \u201cvery deflated\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen this all started, I thought I would be able to put my most important skills to use. I thought we were going to face a difficult pandemic but that I would be able to help the population,\u201d Mr Lennon told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI feel we are trying to roll a boulder up a hill.\u201d\n\n'We are having to choose who lives and who dies'\n\nCear\u00e1 state has recorded the second-highest number of cases, after S\u00e3o Paulo. Intensive care units are at near-full capacity, despite the number of beds having doubled since the pandemic began.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Intensive care units in several Brazilian cities are fast running out of beds\n\nMs Oliveira works at an emergency unit treating Covid-19 patients. \u201cWe are having to decide who is going to be ventilated and who isn\u2019t,\u201d she says.\n\nMany patients have died waiting and all staff can do is give palliative care \u201cto let them go in peace\u201d, she adds.\n\nThe city has installed large refrigerated containers to store the bodies of coronavirus victims but the gravity of the situation is not appreciated by all Brazilians, argues Italo Lennon.\n\n\"Many people are choosing not to believe reality,\" he says.\n\n\u201cPeople are ignoring social distancing rules, they are refusing to wear masks, they are taking part in gatherings.\n\n\u201cWe hear about parties that happened at the house of so and so,\u201d Mr Lennon says. \u201cWe are trying to convince people of the problem that is right in front of them. Our biggest problem is fake news.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Instagram removed a post shared by a state legislator in which he claimed the death toll was being exaggerated by officials to instil fear in the population.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aerial footage of Latin America's biggest graveyard\n\nThe information was subsequently found to be false and removed \u2013 but only after being shared by Mr Bolsonaro.\n\nIn March, Twitter and Facebook deleted presidential posts after identifying them as fake news.\n\nLast month, rumours - which have since been disproved - that authorities in the Amazonian city of Manaus were filling graves with empty coffins to inflate the death toll went viral on social media.\n\nDivisions run deep and are even splitting families apart.\n\nMs Oliveira says she has stopped talking to her four brothers because they have all been following Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s advice.\n\nShe says she got \u201cvery upset\u201d because they will not take any precautions or stop visiting her elderly parents.\n\nFrontline staff like her are making sacrifices during the pandemic - such as being separated from their children and partners for weeks - sacrifices she feels are not being respected by those ignoring restrictions.\n\nFor Ms Oliveira, denial only worsens the situation - and increases her anguish.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for all this political polarisation, we could save more lives.\u201d"}
