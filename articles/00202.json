From Tuesday, with a handful of new defections, they are sitting as an official group in the National Assembly, entitling them to parliamentary privileges and status.\n\nThe main beef of these MPs is that President Macron's party has failed in its promise to be inclusive and to transcend the old political divisions. In spirit, they were all on the left or ecological wings of the LREM. And they feel that since 2017 Macron has made a lot of overtures to the right, but not many to the left.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption One member of the new party, C\u00e9dric Villani, decided to stand as an independent candidate for Paris mayor in March\n\nThe analysis may well be correct. Polls show that more voters on the right than on the left generally approve of the Macron presidency. He has shifted rightwards.\n\nBut the timing of the bloc's initiative raises questions. Everyone knows that after the Covid-19 crisis things will be different. There is no way on Earth that Mr Macron will be carrying on as before. Indeed most likely the new priorities will be themes such as ecology, industrial protection and higher wages for health workers - all of which the breakaway MPs would presumably regard as their own.\n\nPresident Macron's ratings have dipped during France's coronavirus outbreak, however those of Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe have increased.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Edouard Philippe: \"The only way to live is to protect ourselves\"\n\nMembers of the new Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity (EDS) group said they had failed to change LREM from the inside and would now take an independent stance, neither allied to the government nor the opposition.\n\nOne of the new party's best-known figures, Paris mayoral candidate C\u00e9dric Villani, told French radio that what was important was that the new party went forward.\n\n\"There's been talk of treason and rebels, but this ninth political group is made of free men and women who want to devote their souls and conscience to defending ecology, democracy and solidarity,\" he told France Inter radio."}
