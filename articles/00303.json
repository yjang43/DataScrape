Obviously, it was an accident.\"\n\nMichael Jordan's children reveal his incredible will to win.\n\n'The last time I've smack talked him'\n\nExamples of such competitiveness were clear throughout the docuseries, which chronicled how nothing and no one stood in the way of Jordan.\n\nHis US teammates experienced that first hand during a legendary practice session ahead of the 1992 Olympic Games, as documented by the show.\n\nThe US had assembled a dream team of NBA stars, including legends such as Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley, but it soon became clear who the true leader was.\n\nJordan famously pulled out all the stops to drag his team to victory in what was supposed to be a training game, settling the score with a number of teammates in what he described as the best game he's ever played in.\n\nIt seems such an edge has continued into his retirement and transcends the sport of basketball.\n\nFormer world no. 1 golfer Brooks Koepka remembers a time when he learned never to trash talk Jordan ever again, during a round with the hall of famer.\n\nGoing into the final two holes, Koepka made the mistake of teasing his opponent, to which Jordan had a simple response.\n\n\"He just tees the ball up, takes his practice swing and looks at me. 'It's the fourth quarter, baby, I don't lose,'\" Koepka told SportsCenter , revealing Jordan went on to win the last two holes.\n\n\"It's probably the last time I've smack talked him.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Zion Williamson on Michael Jordan and 'The Last Dance' Replay More Videos ...

But when it was on, it was on.\""}
