The man had asked for money, but Arenas was looking to spend the $10 in cash he had on gas before heading to where he usually purchases lottery tickets.\n\nThe three-time All-Star said he'd be willing to give him $5 and purchase $5 worth of gas, an offer the man declined because he said Arenas wouldn't make the trip on $5. The man told him to keep the $10 and joked that he owed $20 instead when he cashed in.\n\nArenas reached his final destination, only to discover the gas station was closed, thus preventing him from getting a ticket.\n\nArenas awakened the next morning to learn he won $300,000 from California's Mega Millions draw on May 12. Since he was such a frequent customer of the gas station, the owner had purchased a ticket and selected the same numbers he always does.\n\nArenas reconnected with the man and provided him with an undisclosed amount of money from his prize."}
