With these samples, scientists are probing some of our most longstanding, and most urgent, questions: What happened in the wake of the dinosaurs? What happens to life when the planet dramatically warms or cools? Can millions of years of Earth history tell us where we're heading?\n\nThe abyss may hold the answers.\n\n\"The workings of the oceans, the Earth's environment and climate are all recorded in the sediments,\" explained Anthony Koppers, a professor of marine geology at Oregon State University.\n\nDrill beneath the sediment on the sea floor and you hit the oceanic crust. One advantage of drilling into oceanic crust is it's approximately 7 kilometers thick, while on land it is many times thicker, explained Koppers. That allows scientists to sample closer to the Earth's mantle."}
