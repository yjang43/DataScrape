He has described his effort to raise the brood as a \"lockdown distraction\".\n\nAnimal welfare charity the Scottish SPCA gave Mr Macdonald advice on how to care for the chicks, which are believed to be blackbirds.\n\nThey were first fed with raw mince mixed with sugared water and have since moved on to a diet of live mealworms supplemented with blueberries and seed."}
