In Israel, wild boar are venturing further into the city of Haifa than before, while dolphins are increasingly braving the Bosphorus, the Turkish narrows that normally serves as a busy shipping route.\n\nOne animal that could see a much-needed revival is the wild bee, scientists say. Bee populations are rapidly declining around the world due to habitat loss, pollution and the use of pesticides, among other factors.\n\n\u201cThese creatures are vital to what we eat and what our countryside looks like,\u201d says Gill Perkins, chief executive of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. \u201cThey provide a whole ecosystem service.\u201d\n\nYou may also like:\n\nA world without bees would look very different and change our lives enormously. Bees are the world\u2019s most important pollinators, fertilising a third of the food we eat and 80% of flowering plants. Bees and other pollinating insects have a global economic value of around \u00a3120bn ($150bn) and contribute around \u00a3690m ($850m) to the UK economy every year, according to a study by the University of Reading."}
