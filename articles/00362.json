Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday\n\n(CNN) All 50 US states have now begun to loosen lockdown restrictions. But a return to normal life looks very different depending on where you live in America.\n\nConnecticut was among the last to lift stay-at-home orders, with stores and offices reopening at 50% capacity today. But, just across the state line, in Massachusetts, nonessential business and office spaces are still closed. That disparity shows the challenges governors face as they weigh up how best to restart their economies without a rulebook.\n\nDetailed guidance released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention yesterday may go some way to helping states make that difficult calculation. The 60-page document, which outlines the categories to consider for schools, restaurants, transit and child care facilities to reopen, had previously been shelved by White House after concerns it was too specific.\n\nA CNN review last week found that the guidelines in the original CDC draft were far more strict and detailed than the White House's own road map. Based on the original guidance, \"no one who is reopening meets the criteria for reopening,\" a senior CDC official told CNN at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization has agreed to an independent inquiry into the global response to the virus, including a probe of its own actions. Member nations rejected President Donald Trump's demands for punitive action. Instead, the message was one of solidarity: Pointing fingers won't help the pandemic now, but investigating how the virus started could prevent it from happening again."}
