Finance Minister Sim\u00f3n Zerpa and Central Bank President Calixto Ortega travelled to London to demand that Venezuela be allowed to take the gold back to Venezuela.\n\nIn January 2019, the Bank of England refused the request. All it said publicly was that it did not comment on customer relationships.\n\nImage caption Venezuela has $1bn worth of gold stored in the Bank of England\n\nThe decision, however, came just days after Mr Maduro's rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, had declared himself president, arguing that the 2018 election which returned Mr Maduro to power had been fraudulent.\n\nMr Guaid\u00f3, who was quickly recognised as the legitimate leader by more than 50 nations - including the UK and the US, asked the Bank of England not to hand the gold over to the Maduro government, arguing that it would be used for corrupt purposes.\n\nThe British minister of state for the Americas at the time, Alan Duncan, said the decision was a matter for the Bank of England and its governor, but added that \"no doubt when they do so they will take into account there are now a large number of countries across the world questioning the legitimacy of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and recognising that of Juan Guaid\u00f3\".\n\nAt the same time, top US officials - for whom President Maduro has long been a thorn - were also lobbying their British counterparts to cut the Maduro government off from its foreign assets.\n\nWhile the Bank of England never went beyond saying that it did not comment on customer relations it is thought that international sanctions on Venezuela and regulations on preventing money laundering influenced its decision.\n\nVenezuela's offer to have the funds transferred to the UN directly are designed to circumvent those regulations."}
