What is more certain is that Ethiopia, widely regarded as the cradle of coffee, is a nation devoted to the stimulating beverage. The country is Africa's biggest producer and ranks fifth globally. Last year it exported 190,000 tonnes of coffee beans, earning around $700 million, and in 2016 Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa will host the 4th World Coffee Conference, a high-level gathering of global experts.\n\nBenan Barwick/CNN Benan Barwick/CNN\n\nCoffee connoisseurs\n\nRead More"}
