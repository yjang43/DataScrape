As a consequence, the second six-episode run feels as if it's essentially retracing old territory -- moving in places, but with less urgency, and more prone to silly detours to flesh out the run.\n\nGervais' formula of two seasons and out (plus a follow-up special) worked well enough for the original \"The Office\" and \"Extras.\" But his filmography has been more uneven of late, with \"After Life\" very much in keeping with the writer-producer-star's outspoken atheism and darker, if not irredeemable view of life.\n\nAs a brief recap, the first season found Gervais' Tony sleepwalking through his days after his beloved wife died of cancer, consoling himself by watching old videos and home movies, with a faithful dog (Eho's a good girl? You are) as a companion.\n\nBy the end, Tony's outlook had brightened, showing traces of generosity toward coworkers at the local newspaper where he grudgingly churned out human-interest stories, and finding a potential new romance in the nurse, Emma (Ashley Jensen, splendid as always), looking after his dementia-stricken dad (David Bradley).\n\nThe new season, however, finds Tony backsliding, again wallowing in grief to the point of endangering his relationship with Emma, who understandably struggles with his behavior. This continues, notably, despite the advice that Tony seems intent on ignoring from his cemetery pal Anne (Penelope Wilton), who chides him not to mess things up.\n\nRead More"}
