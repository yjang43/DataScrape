UFC fighter and Dagestan native Khabib Nurmagomedov has even spoken out about the problems there.\n\nOn Wednesday Russia's confirmed cases rose above 300,000 and the country reported a record daily rise in deaths of 135, bringing the total toll to 2,972.\n\nInfections however are slowing, with the daily rise in cases the lowest since 1 May. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin - who has only just returned to work after contracting the virus - has said the country is entering a more stable phase of its outbreak, but warned of the need to lift restrictions with care."}
