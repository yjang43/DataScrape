Social-distancing rules were still in effect.\n\nAround the world, governments are starting to relax some of their coronavirus restrictions.\n\nMost countries have taken measures to protect against the spread of Covid-19: enforcing stay-at-home orders, closing nonessential businesses and advising people to wear protective gear and keep a safe distance from one another.\n\nMany of those guidelines still apply. But beaches are beginning to reopen, some students are returning to classrooms, and businesses are opening their doors for the first time in weeks."}
