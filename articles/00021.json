Smith is the carver behind the new statue in Portland stone of Sir Hans Sloane, the founder of the British Museum, which stands in Chelsea Physic Garden. He\u2019s now turned his efforts to domestic, decorative creations that could go above the mantelpiece in place of an oil painting.\n\nNot every designer using stone is a purist. London-based New Zealander Phil Cuttance works in Jesmonite \u2013 ground-up stone mixed with an acrylic resin. \u201cIf Jesmonite didn\u2019t exist, I wouldn\u2019t work in stone,\u201d he says, because \u201cif you make a wrong move it\u2019s ruined. Stone is beautiful, ancient, and precious.\u201d Instead, he makes \u201csmaller things for more people\u201d, such as his series of herringbone-patterned vases and pleated mirror frames.\n\nOnce out of the mould, Cuttance etches it. \u201cWhen people look at my objects, they assume they\u2019re made by a computer router or 3D printer because of the complex geometry and sharp lines. When they get up close, they see they\u2019re hand-crafted, and have come out of very low-fi process.\u201d He\u2019s now following up these pieces with a range of lighting."}
