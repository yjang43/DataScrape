It\u2019s a moral issue.\u201d\n\nIn her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.\n\nSixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\n\nSeventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Effectively insulating your home is an important step\n\nOther top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy.\n\nDr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.\n\nCurrent annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.\n\n'Valuable' study\n\nThe study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Outside of lockdown, taking fewer flights can make a major contribution to cutting carbon\n\nSome of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don\u2019t.\n\nProfessor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: \u201cThis is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.\n\nLibby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren\u2019t necessarily covered by this study.\u201d\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}
