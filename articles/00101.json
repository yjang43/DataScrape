He had a knife, but managed to unwrap the whale's fin from the nets.\n\nImage copyright ABC NEWS Image caption The whale had been trapped in the shark nets\n\nOther Australian news outlets reported a crowd of spectators watched the rescue from the shore.\n\nObserver Andre Borrell told the Gold Coast Bulletin newspaper they had initially waited for hours for authorities to turn up.\n\n\"Luckily a good Samaritan came up and did fisheries' [officials] jobs for them,\" he said.\n\nThe use of shark nets around Australian beaches is controversial due to their impact on other wildlife.\n\nLast year, there were at least five whales found caught in the state's nets, prompting calls for other shark deterrents to be used instead."}
