Singapore Changi Airport\n\n2. Tokyo Haneda Airport\n\n3. Hamad International Airport (Doha, Qatar)\n\n4. Incheon International Airport (South Korea)\n\n5. Munich Airport (Germany)\n\n6. Hong Kong International Airport\n\n7. Narita International Airport (Tokyo)\n\n8. Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya, Japan)\n\n9. Amsterdam Schiphol Airport\n\n10. Kansai International Airport (Osaka, Japan)\n\nAccording to Skytrax, customers from more than 100 different countries participated in the survey, which was conducted from September 2019 to February 2020 and covers 550 airports.\n\nSingapore's win was practically guaranteed. The April 2019 opening of the Jewel Changi Airport , a multi-use complex designed to connect three of Changi Airport's four terminals, bolstered the hub's already impressive array of offerings.\n\nFeaturing a dramatic, doughnut-shaped exterior framed in steel and glass, the 135,700-square-meter (around 1.46 million square feet) addition was designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie. Jewel's star attraction is the 40-meter-tall (around 130 feet) HSBC Rain Vortex, which cascades through a huge oculus in the middle and is billed as the world's tallest indoor waterfall.\n\nRelated content How Asia's airports are changing the way we travel\n\n\"Changi Airport is humbled to receive this affirmation from our travelers, made possible by the strong support from our airport partners,\" said Lee Seow Hiang, Chief Executive Officer of Changi Airport Group in a pre-recorded clip played during the online ceremony.\n\n\"This has been a challenging year for all us. Like everyone else, here at Changi, we continue to do our best to safeguard and protect the health of our travelers, our visitors and our airport workers. We wish everyone in the international aviation community well. Let's look forward to better times and soon.\"\n\nTokyo's Haneda is the fifth busiest airport in the world. Yet it delivered 85.6% of flights on time in 2018, making it the most punctual mega airport in the world.\n\nJapan dominates multiple categories\n\nThough Tokyo Haneda might have been bested by Singapore's Changi in the main \"World's Best Airport\" category, it did snag the \"World's Best Domestic Airport\" and \"World's Cleanest Airport\" prizes.\n\n\n\nAlso in Japan, Osaka's Kansai International Airport was awarded \"World's Best Airport Staff Service,\" Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya got the \"World's Best Regional Airport\" prize and Tokyo's Narita International Airport was awarded \"World's Best Airport Dining.\"\n\nRelated content Behind the scenes at the world's most punctual mega airport\n\nMoving to South Korea, Incheon International Airport's T2 won the \"World's Best Airport Terminal\" award.
