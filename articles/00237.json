In the nearly three-week test of endurance, he has raised $102,000 (\u00a383,243) for the Manx Solidarity Fund at the time of writing.\n\nThe charity has been established in response to difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic on the Isle of Man, and Varley has more than quadrupled his initial target of $23,250 (\u00a319,000).\n\nChristian Varley celebrates with his daughter after completing his 19th marathon.\n\n\"What a special day that was. I think I'm going to struggle topping that,\" Varley, who won last year's Isle of Man Marathon, told Manx Radio."}
