Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies\n\nThe outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.\n\nThe true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted.\n\nGlobally, more than 4.5 billion people - half the world's population - have been living under social distancing measures, according to the AFP news agency's estimates.\n\nThose restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger.\n\nWhere are coronavirus cases still rising?\n\nWhile some countries are starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following the introduction of strict lockdown restrictions, others are only now seeing them rise.\n\nA sharp increase in cases in Latin America has led the WHO to say the Americas are currently at the centre of the pandemic.\n\nThese charts show four countries where deaths are on an upward trajectory - as shown by the red lines.\n\nBrazil now has the third highest number of infections in the world - overtaking the UK, Spain and Italy. However, the country's health experts have warned that the real number of confirmed infections could be far higher, due to a lack of testing.\n\nBruno Covas, mayor of Brazil's largest city, S\u00e3o Paulo, which is home to 12 million people, has warned its health system could collapse because of the growing demand for emergency beds.\n\nMexico has also seen a spike in new infections, while Ecuador saw its health system collapse in April.\n\nOutside South America, Russia has seen infections rise rapidly and now has the second highest number worldwide, according to official data. It has been reporting around 10,000 new cases a day since the beginning of May.\n\nIn Africa, Lesotho confirmed its first cases on 13 May, which means coronavirus is now present in all countries on the continent, mainly in urban populations. Worst-hit are South Africa, Egypt and Algeria.\n\nEurope easing lockdown restrictions\n\nAfter being labelled the \"epicentre of the pandemic \" by the WHO in March, Europe is now slowly beginning to ease restrictions brought in to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThe UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, now appear to have passed the peak, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling.\n\nThe UK and Italy have seen more than 30,000 deaths, while France and Spain have both recorded about 28,000.\n\nHowever, differences in population size and how countries report their figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means international comparisons are complicated.\n\nEuropean countries have varied in their plans to ease lockdowns, but the WHO has urged all nations to adopt a \"slow, steady\" approach.\n\nNew York the worst-hit in US outbreak\n\nWith more than 1.5 million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. It has also recorded more than 90,000 deaths.\n\nThe state of New York has been particularly badly affected, with more than 28,000 deaths, but the number of new cases there has been on a downward trend in recent weeks.\n\nAt one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but many states have now begun to loosen their stay-at-home restrictions and allowed some businesses to reopen - a move health officials fear could further spread the virus.\n\nTop US infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci has cautioned against opening up public life too soon, warning of further \"little spikes\" which could become bigger outbreaks.\n\nPresident Trump, who disagrees with Dr Fauci's advice, has made it clear he is keen to reopen the US economy \"vaccine or no vaccine\".\n\nThe latest figures show more than 36 million people have lost their jobs since the outbreak hit the US. That's nearly a quarter of the American workforce.\n\nThe rise means the jobless rate is now worse than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nAbout this data\n\nThe data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations.\n\nWhen comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.\n\nOther factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of the a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic."}
