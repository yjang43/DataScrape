Iranian authorities later released photos of the Konorak ship docked at a harbor in an apparent bid to dispel rumors that the vessel had sunk.\n\nThe Konorak, a logistical vessel armed with a 20mm-caliber cannon and anti-ship cruise missile launchers, was damaged at night, according official and semi-official media. The Konorak also goes on reconnaissance missions and lays mines. Some 40 people were on board.\n\nIran, which was already buckling under the strain of US sanctions, is also tackling one of the world's biggest outbreaks of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRead More"}
