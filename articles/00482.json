Once you get past the soapy title, this six-episode limited series offers a grim but gripping adaptation of Wally Lamb's book, rife with tormented family history and the struggle to overcome the past.\n\nWe meet the more troubled brother, Thomas, in grisly fashion, engaging in an act that will force Dominick, a house painter, to take a more active role in overseeing his care. \"Thank you for being a good brother to me,\" Thomas says pitifully.\n\nFor Dominick, the burden of dealing with Thomas has been left to him by their late mother (played by Melissa Leo), and he feels the weight of the obligation. In that respect, the theme bears a considerable resemblance to \"Promise,\" one of the great Hallmark Hall of Fame movies, with James Garner charged with handling his increasingly disturbed brother, played by James Woods.\n\nLamb's 1998 novel -- an Oprah's book club selection -- and this adaptation by writer/director Derek Cianfrance (\"The Place Beyond the Pines\") contain several additional layers. For starters, there's the whole twin aspect, and questions about what made one brother turn out this way and the other not. In that, Dominick is guided by a psychiatrist (\"The Good Wife's\" Archie Panjabi) despite his resistance, initially telling her, \"There's no use delving into the secrets of the past.\"\n\nThe story also reaches beyond this generation's DNA to the family's dark history, with Dominick learning more about that than he ever wanted to. Finally, there's the devastating tragedy he experienced in his own life, one that upended his relationship with his wife (Kathryn Hahn) and has undermined future romances going forward.\n\nRead More"}
