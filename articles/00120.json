They have been seen as divine messages, a way of unleashing creativity and, since the advent of psychoanalysis in the 19th Century, the key to understanding our unconscious. As so many of us have been experiencing unusually vivid dreams in recent weeks, it seems an opportune moment to explore the way in which they have been understood and depicted throughout the centuries. In doing so we may even find some intriguing parallels with our own experiences.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The art history of masks\n\n- Paintings that find light in darkness\n\n- The rainbows that swept the world\n\nBut why are we dreaming so vividly now? \u201cWe\u2019re in a new situation so there\u2019s new emotions to process,\u201d says psychotherapist Philippa Perry, who was inundated with replies when she recently asked her followers to send her their dreams on Twitter. We make up narratives to make sense of those feelings that in dream manifest themselves \u201cnot straightforwardly but in metaphors\u201d, she explains."}
