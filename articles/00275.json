The team has relocated to Pensacola, Florida for the winter.\n\n\"She's going to be a great tool for us and you can't help but think what we learn over the coming months on and off the water with this boat is going to be invaluable to our success in Auckland in 2021,\" said skipper Terry Hutchinson.\n\n\"Each milestone you're building to the next one and as always a measure of the team and the execution and the consistency is 90 minutes into the first sail we were foiling and we executed a foiling maneuver. That was for me the best part about it.\"\n\nAmerican Magic sailing its AC75 \"Defiant\" on Narragansett Bay.\n\n'Extremely complex'\n\nIn Britain, Olympic legend Ben Ainslie's INEOS Team UK outfit launched its first generation AC75 \"Britannia\" at its Old Portsmouth base on the south coast of England.\n\nWith full backing from the INEOS petrochemical billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, Ainslie is striving to win the Cup for Britain for the first time since the inaugural race in 1851.\n\nIn Bermuda, his then Land Rover BAR outfit struggled, but after building a smaller scale 28-feet-long test boat named \"T5\" the team has been busy testing \"Britannia\" in the UK and its winter base in Cagliari, Sardinia.\n\n\"The things that will win the next edition are the ability to sail the boat at close to optimum performance for the most time during the race, having the best foil package -- rudders and foils will be important -- and the ride control, how you control the ride of the boat,\" Simmer told the team's website.\n\n\"What I'm nervous about is that it's such a new class of boat that you could miss something. We're in this broad, open, design area. Not necessarily the biggest, or the strongest team will win. It will be somebody who has really understood the concept of the boat the best and made the best decisions.\"\n\nINEOS Team UK tests its AC75 \"Britannia\" on the waters of the Solent in southern England.\n\nF1 partnership\n\nINEOS head designer Nick Holroyd added: \"These boats are extremely complex. The part count in the foils, the level of detailed mechanical engineering is exceptional. I would suggest a step up in complexity from where the Cup has been before, so it's a fun area to play in, which is kind of cool.\"\n\nBut he stressed the design work is ongoing: \"Race boat two will be more than just a refinement of boat one.\"\n\nRatcliffe's business also funds the seven-time Tour de France-winning Team INEOS professional cycling outfit (formerly Team Sky), and has recently signed a technical partnership with Mercedes AMG-Petronas Motorsport, the F1 world champion.\n\n\"There's an incredible amount of synergy across of all the sports, Formula 1, cycling and the America's Cup -- it's a fascinating mixture of pushing the boundaries of technical innovation alongside sporting prowess,\" Ainslie told the team's website.\n\nClock is ticking\n\nThe fourth AC75 is Italy's Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, which was launched at the team's base in Cagliari, Sardinia in early October.\n\nAs the challenger of record, the Italian syndicate was the first to officially challenge Team New Zealand to defend the Cup and as such had input into the design choice of the AC75.\n\n\"A lot of effort has gone into reducing the transition time between the phase where the hull is fully in the water and the flying phase; it is a difficult balance to achieve, and we will continue to work on it during the development stage,\" said skipper and team boss Max Sirena at the boat's launch.\n\nOnly the second American syndicate Stars and Stripes has yet to launch an AC75.\n\nThe clock is ticking for everyone."}
