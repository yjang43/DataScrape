The Bundesliga, Germany's top pro soccer league, became the first major European competition to return amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has now spread across the world.\n\nThe illness was first reported in late December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China's Hubei province. It has found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica, and many countries have declared a national emergency.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared it to be a pandemic, the first since the H1N1 flu in 2009.\n\nCoronavirus symptoms can look like a common cold or flu. But for those with a weaker immune system, the virus could cause more serious illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis."}
