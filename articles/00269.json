French Rugby president Bernard Laporte, running unopposed, moved into Pichot's vacated vice-chairman position.\n\n\"I am honored to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support,\" Beaumont was quoted as saying by World Rugby's website.\n\n\"I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years,\" he continued.\n\n\"While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant.\"\n\nRead More"}
