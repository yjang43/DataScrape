Figures from the Board of Deputies of British Jews say that 458 Jews have lost their lives to the virus since the pandemic began.\n\nSome of the reasons for that are demographic \u2013 many Jews are older, and they usually live in large urban areas \u2013 both factors which increase the risk of serious infection.
