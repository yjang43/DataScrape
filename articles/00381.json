Pretty humbling, isn't it?\" said Shannon Olsson, an associate professor of naturalist-inspired chemical ecology at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India, and an author of a new study that published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.\n\n\"Understanding how an insect navigates in the world with only a few hundred thousand neurons in their brain (unlike our human 80 billion) can help us to create better technology that uses less computational power,\" she said.\n\nOlsson had long wondered how insects are so good at finding things several miles away, but given how tiny they are and how fast they duck and weave \u2014 something anyone who has tried to swat a fly can attest to \u2014 exploring this in their natural environment has proved difficult, she said.\n\nRead More"}
