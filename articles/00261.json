Motorcycle taxis hummed through the streets, construction workers pounded away at steel and cement, and street vendors worked hard to sell their products. But everything seemed to stop when a white luxury SUV pulled up, and a face recognizable to everyone in this neighborhood emerged.\n\nCNN was with football legend Samuel Eto'o when he last visited his hometown in February, before the coronavirus pandemic forced countries around the world into lockdown. Many of New Bell's residents filled the streets as word spread that the international superstar had returned home. One woman, dressed only in a bath towel, hastily hopped out the shower to greet him -- not wanting to miss her chance.\n\n\"People come out massively because I bring a feeling of happiness, hope,\" Eto'o said, through a translator. \"I hope God Almighty still allows me to share that feeling with them.\"\n\nPhotos: Samuel Eto'o's glittering career National hero \u2013 Samuel Eto'o played 118 times for Cameroon, scoring 56 goals.

At one point, they even formed a human chain to allow Eto'o to walk through the blocks and visit some of his loved ones.\n\n\"I grew up in the hands of people you saw,\" he said. \"Some are my paternal uncles, and others are elders in the neighborhood who took care of me in my teens; who would advise me because they felt I had something and I could get out.\""}
