As a CNN reporter asked a question via video link, the prime minister looked deep in concentration, scribbling notes and pausing to look at the monitor only once. As he launched into his answer, he looked directly into the camera to boast about Spain\u2019s Covid-19 testing volume.\n\n\u201cWe are one of the countries with the highest number of tests carried out,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.\n\nInitially, the prime minister cited data from a recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ranking that had placed Spain eighth in Covid-19 testing among its members.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have found out about another study, from the Johns Hopkins University, that [\u2026] ranks us fifth in the world in total tests carried out.\u201d\n\nThere were just two problems: The OECD data had been wrong. And while some sources had ranked Spain fifth in total testing volume, Johns Hopkins was not one of them; the study S\u00e1nchez cited does not exist.\n\nYet two weeks later, the Spanish government is standing by the substance of its prime minister\u2019s claim. Instead of citing Johns Hopkins, Spanish officials are now pointing to testing rankings from a data aggregation website called Worldometer \u2014 one of the sources behind the university\u2019s widely cited coronavirus dashboard \u2014 and prompting questions about why some governments and respected institutions have chosen to trust a source about which little is known.\n\nWhat is Worldometer?\n\nBefore the pandemic, Worldometer was best known for its \u201ccounters,\u201d which provided live estimates of numbers like the world\u2019s population or the number of cars produced this year. Its website indicates that revenue comes from advertising and licensing its counters. The Covid-19 crisis has undoubtedly boosted the website\u2019s popularity. It\u2019s one of the top-ranking Google search results for coronavirus stats. In the past six months, Worldometer\u2019s pages have been shared about 2.5 million times \u2014 up from just 65 shares in the first six months of 2019, according to statistics provided by BuzzSumo, a company that tracks social media engagement and provides insights into content.\n\nAccessible icon title Questioning the reliability of this coronavirus statistics site 03:36\n\nThe website claims to be \u201crun by an international team of developers, researchers, and volunteers\u201d and \u201cpublished by a small and independent digital media company based in the United States.\u201d\n\nBut public records show little evidence of a company that employs a multilingual team of analysts and researchers. It\u2019s not clear whether the company has paid staff vetting its data for accuracy or whether it relies solely on automation and crowdsourcing. The site does have at least one job posting, from October, seeking a volunteer web developer.\n\nOnce known as Worldometers, the website was originally created in 2004 by Andrey Alimetov, then a 20-year-old recent immigrant from Russia who had just gotten his first IT job in New York.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a super simple website, there is nothing crazy about it,\u201d he recently told CNN.\n\nWithin about a year, Alimetov said, the site was getting 20,000 or 30,000 visits every day but costing him too much money in web-hosting fees.\n\n\u201cThere was no immediate fast way to cash out,\u201d he said, so he listed the site on eBay and sold it for $2,000 sometime in 2005 or 2006.\n\nChanging hands Source: Andrey Alimetov\n\nWhen Reddit\u2019s homepage featured his old site in 2013, Alimetov emailed the buyer, a man named Dario, to congratulate him.\n\nIn his reply, Dario said he bought the site to drive traffic to his other websites.\n\nAs those businesses \u201cstarted to decline, I decided to invest on Worldometers, bringing in resources and people until eventually it took a course of its own,\u201d Dario wrote.\n\nWorldometer no longer bears its trailing \u201cs\u201d except in its URL. Beyond that, not much has changed.\n\nToday, the Worldometer website is owned by a company called Dadax LLC.\n\nRepresentatives for Worldometer and Dadax did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for interviews, but state business filings show Dadax was first formed in Delaware, in 2002. The filing lists a PO box as the company\u2019s address. From 2003 to 2015, business filings in Connecticut and New Jersey listed Dadax\u2019s president as Dario Pasqualino. Addresses on the filings tied the company and Pasqualino to homes in Princeton, New Jersey, and Greenwich, Connecticut. The company is still actively registered in Delaware and has been in good standing since 2010.\n\nThe company shares the Dadax name with a Shanghai-based software firm. In March, both companies issued statements denying a connection. The Chinese Dadax said it issued its statement after receiving \u201cmany calls and emails\u201d about the stats site. Worldometer, in a tweet, said it\u2019s never had \u201cany type of affiliation with any entity based in China.\u201d\n\nIDs in the source code for Worldometer and the US Dadax\u2019s websites link them to at least two dozen other websites that appear to share ownership. Some appear to be defunct. Others, such as usalivestats.com, italiaora.org and stopthehunger.com, share the same premise: live stats counters. Most of the sites have a rudimentary aesthetic, reminiscent of a 1990s or early 2000s internet. Some seem quite random. One Italian site displays Christmas poems and gift suggestions, like a bonsai plant (for her), or a plot of land on the moon (for him). Another site is dedicated to Sicilian puppet shows.\n\nA person with Pasqualino\u2019s name and birthday is also registered as a sole proprietor in Italy. That business manages and sells \u201cadvertising space,\u201d according to an Italian registration document filed last year. Its address leads to a tidy, three-story apartment building on a leafy street in an upscale neighborhood in Bologna.\n\nCNN was unable to reach Pasqualino through contact information listed on Worldometer and in public records.\n\nAccording to Worldometer\u2019s website, its Covid-19 data comes from a multilingual team that \u201cmonitors press briefings\u2019 live streams throughout the day\u201d and through crowdsourcing.\n\nVisitors can report new Covid-19 numbers and data sources to the website \u2013 no name or email address required. A \u201cteam of analysts and researchers\u201d validate the data, the website says. It may, at first, sound like the Wikipedia of the data world, but some Wikipedia editors have decided to avoid Worldometer as a source for Covid-19 data.\n\n\u201cSeveral updates lack a source, do not match their cited source or contain errors,\u201d one editor, posting under the username MarioGom, wrote on a discussion page for Wikipedia editors working on Covid-19-related content last month. \u201cSome errors are small and temporary, but some are relatively big and never corrected.\u201d\n\nThe editor, whose real name is Mario G\u00f3mez, told CNN in an email, \u201cInstead of trying to use a consistent criteria, [Worldometer] seems to be going for the highest figure. They have a system for users to report higher figures, but so far I failed to use it to report that some figure is erroneous and should be lower.\u201d\n\nEdouard Mathieu, the data manager for Our World in Data (OWID), an independent statistics website headquartered at Oxford University, has seen a similar trend.\n\n\u201cTheir main focus seems to be having the latest number wherever it comes from, whether it\u2019s reliable or not, whether it\u2019s well-sourced or not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think people should be wary, especially media, policy-makers and decision-makers. This data is not as accurate as they think it is.\u201d\n\nVirginia Pitzer, a Yale University epidemiologist focused on modeling Covid-19\u2019s spread in the United States, said she\u2019d never heard of Worldometer. CNN asked her to assess the website\u2019s reliability.\n\n\u201cI think the Worldometer site is legitimate,\u201d she wrote via email, explaining that many of its sources appear to be credible government websites. But she also found flaws, inconsistencies and an apparent lack of expert curation. \u201cThe interpretation of the data is lacking,\u201d she wrote, explaining that she found the data on active cases \u201cparticularly problematic\u201d because data on recoveries is not consistently reported.\n\nPitzer also found few detailed explanations of data reporting issues or discrepancies. For Spain, it\u2019s a single sentence. For many other countries, there are no explanations at all.\n\nShe also found errors. In the Spanish data, for instance, Worldometer reports more than 18,000 recoveries on April 24. The Spanish government reported 3,105 recoveries that day.\n\nAccuracy, fairness and apples-to-apples comparisons\n\nWhen Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez boasted of Spain\u2019s high rankings, he didn\u2019t pull his numbers out of thin air. On April 27, the OECD wrongly ranked Spain eighth in testing per capita. Initially, the OECD had used data from OWID to compile its statistics. But it sourced the Spanish numbers independently because OWID\u2019s data was incomplete. The mixed sourcing skewed Spain\u2019s position in the ranking because it counted a broader category of tests than the other countries\u2019 numbers. The organization corrected itself the next day, two hours before S\u00e1nchez\u2019s press conference, bumping Spain to 17th place.\n\nIn its statement, the OECD said \u201cwe regret the confusion created on a sensitive issue by any debate on methodological issues\u201d and stressed that increasing the availability of testing in general is more important than knowing where any particular country ranks.\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s later reference to a Johns Hopkins study, in which he said Spain ranked fifth for testing worldwide, appears to have been a case of mixed-up attribution by the prime minister. JHU has not published international testing figures. Jill Rosen, a spokeswoman for the school, told CNN the university couldn\u2019t identify a report that matched S\u00e1nchez\u2019s description.\n\nAt a press conference on May 9, S\u00e1nchez evaded a CNN question pressing him on the JHU study\u2019s existence and listed the government\u2019s numbers on testing totals instead. In comments made to a Spanish reporter the next day, health minister Salvador Illa continued to insist the testing data had been released by JHU, though he pointed to Worldometer as the underlying source. Since Johns Hopkins gets its data from Worldometer, he argued, it\u2019s just as good.\n\n\u201cIt is data given by the John Hopkins University [\u2026] taken from as a fundamental source of information, the website Worldometer,\u201d Illa said. \u201cYou can check it.\u201d\n\nIt is true that on April 28, Worldometer\u2019s data had ranked Spain fifth when it came to total testing volume. At the time, OWID data also ranked Spain fifth, but as more countries began reporting larger testing volumes, it became clear how Worldometer\u2019s data is flawed. Its Spain figure includes both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which show if patients are currently infected, and antibody tests, which indicate if patients were ever infected. For most countries besides Spain, Worldometer's data appears to only count PCR tests.\n\nBecause so few countries report antibodies testing data and to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, OWID says it only tracks PCR tests. By that measure, as of May 17, Spain ranks sixth, behind the US, Russia, Germany, Italy and India. Worldometer ranked Spain fourth.\n\nBut relying on the ranking by the raw number of tests performed is still misleading because it doesn\u2019t account for population differences between countries.\n\nOWID\u2019s data manager, Edouard Mathieu, says a much fairer way to compare testing data is to account for population size. As of May 10, OWID placed Spain 19th in testing per 1,000 people. Worldometer placed Spain 15th by a similar measure.\n\nTale of two rankings Worldometer\u2019s data does rank Spain fifth in terms of total testing volume. But relying on raw numbers is misleading because it doesn\u2019t account for differences between countries. When adjusted for population, Spain\u2019s ranking falls to 16th. Experts say this data, from Worldometer, is further flawed beacuse its Spain figure counts a broader category of tests than most other countries\u2019. Top 20 countries by\u2026 Total tests performed Tests performed per 1 million residents\n\nRoberto Rodr\u00edguez Aramayo, a research professor at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)\u2019s Institute of Philosophy and a former president of a Spanish ethics association, said Spain is reporting data from both the most and least reliable types of tests.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there seems to be certain [political] interests in the readings that are given of these data, when they are shown,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat does Worldometer have to do with Johns Hopkins University?\n\nJohns Hopkins has not published international data on Covid-19 testing, but it does list Worldometer as one of several sources for its widely-cited coronavirus dashboard.\n\nThe university has declined to say what specific data points it relies on Worldometer for, but issues with the counter site\u2019s data have caused at least one notable error.\n\nOn April 8, JHU\u2019s global tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases briefly crossed 1.5 million before dropping by more than 30,000. Johns Hopkins later posted an explanation for the incident on its GitHub page. At the time, JHU told CNN the error appeared to come from a double counting of French nursing home cases. But French officials told CNN there had been no revision, not even to nursing home data. Johns Hopkins\u2019 data appeared to come directly from Worldometer. The website listed no source for its figure.\n\nOne Wikipedia editor, James Heilman, a clinical assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia, said Wikipedia volunteers have noticed persistent errors with Worldometer, but also with \u201ca more reputable name with a longer history of accuracy,\u201d referring to Johns Hopkins. \u201cWe hope they also double check the numbers.\u201d\n\nJohns Hopkins\u2019 response Source: Johns Hopkins University\n\nIn an article published in February, JHU said it began manually tracking Covid-19 data for its dashboard in January. When that became unsustainable, the university began scraping data from primary sources and aggregation websites. Lauren Gardner, the associate engineering professor who runs the university\u2019s Covid-19 dashboard, told CNN in a statement that the university uses a \u201ctwo-stage anomaly detection system\u201d to catch potential data problems. \u201cModerate\u201d changes are automatically added to the dashboard but flagged so staff can double-check them in real time. Changes beyond a certain threshold require \u201ca human to manually check and approve the values before publication to the dashboard,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nThe university\u2019s reliance on Worldometer has surprised some academics.\n\nPhil Beaver, a data scientist at the University of Denver, seemed at a loss for words when he was asked what he thought of JHU citing Worldometer.\n\n\u201cI am not sure, that is a great question, I kind of got the impression that Worldometer was relying on [Johns] Hopkins,\u201d he told CNN after a lengthy pause.\n\nMathieu also seemed taken aback.\n\n\u201cI think JHU has been under a lot of pressure to update their numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of this pressure they have been forced to or incentivized to get data from places that they shouldn\u2019t have, but in general I would expect JHU to be a fairly reliable source.\u201d\n\nIn the university\u2019s response to CNN, Gardner said Worldometer was one of \u201cdozens\u201d of sources and that \u201cbefore incorporating any new source, we validate their data by comparing it against other references.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe try not to use a single source for any of our data,\u201d Gardner added. \u201cWe use reporting from public health agencies and sources of aggregation to cross-validate numbers.\u201d\n\nThe British government cited Worldometer data on Covid-19 deaths during its daily press conferences for much of April, before switching to Johns Hopkins data.\n\n\u201cBoth Worldometers and John Hopkins provided comprehensive and well-respected data. As the situation developed, we transferred from Worldometers to John Hopkins as John Hopkins relies more on official sources,\u201d read a statement from a UK government spokesperson.\n\n\u2018Contaminating public opinion\u2019\n\nIn Spain, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s apparent Johns Hopkins misattribution has become a major controversy. In parliament on Wednesday, center-right People\u2019s Party MP Cayetana Alvarez de Toledo called the government the party \u201cof the lies to CNN and the Spanish people.\u201d\n\nOn May 10, a spokeswoman for Spain\u2019s embassy in London complained to CNN about its coverage of the matter.\n\n\u201cBack in April Mr. S\u00e1nchez mentioned analysis of statistical data carried out by Johns Hopkins University that are based upon data published by Worldometer,\u201d the spokeswoman wrote in an email sent to the network\u2019s diplomatic editor just after 4 a.m.\n\n\u201cEven if Mr. S\u00e1nchez did not mention Worldometer as a primary source in his remarks, [CNN] could have known that most of the comparisons and analysis on Covid-19 in the world use [Worldometer\u2019s] tables.\u201d\n\nIn remarks to CNN, a spokesperson for the prime minister\u2019s office acknowledged that Worldometer counts PCR tests and antibodies tests together and rejected critics\u2019 call to adjust testing numbers for population, calling it a \u201ctrap that the OECD and the Spanish press [\u2026] has fallen into\u201d and arguing that Spain should not be compared with small countries like Malta, Luxembourg or Bahrain.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, though, why the Spanish government continues to insist that the testing data published by Worldometer was put out by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIts refusal to acknowledge its attribution error comes just a month after Spain\u2019s Justice Minister Juan Carlos Campo said the government was considering changes to the law, seeking to crack down on those peddling misinformation.\n\n\"I believe, it is more than justified -- with the calm, tranquility needed for any legal changes -- that we review what our legal instruments are to stop those contaminating public opinion in a serious and unjustified way,\" Campo said.\n\nAt the time, Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth told CNN in an email, \u201cIf the justice minister is suggesting penalizing speech that contaminates public opinion, that would be very dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurning the government into a censor would undermine that public accountability precisely at the moment when it is most needed,\u201d Roth warned.\n\nIn her letter to CNN, the embassy spokeswoman was emphatic that Spain was \u2014 and still is \u2014 fifth in the world in Covid-19 testing, attaching screenshots of Worldometer tables as proof."}
