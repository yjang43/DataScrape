But \"Crucible\" might already be too late to the game.\n\n\"Crucible,\" which will be released May 20, was delayed twice due to Covid-19, according to franchise lead Colin Johanson. First as the development team adapted to working from home and then because the team questioned the timing of publishing a game during a pandemic.\n\nCNN Business got an early look at the game and the chance to play alongside other press and game developers online.\n\nThe game is free to play and available only on PC. It combines elements from adventure and questing games, like defeating monsters for experience points, as well as features from popular shooters.\n\n\"Crucible\" is set in an apocalyptic world where very few people are able to venture outside. Those who do must find work as freelancers, hunting creatures to collect essence, a special material that helps them level up and grow more powerful. Like 2019's \"Death Stranding\" from Hideo Kojima , a game which centers on a delivery guy's attempts to keep his packages safe while traversing a wasteland, those themes might resonate too closely with an audience facing the pandemic.\n\nRead More"}
