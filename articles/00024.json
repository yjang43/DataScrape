It\u2019s disrespectful, but in a celebratory way,\u201d says Barbato. \u201cI do think that public-access TV was absolutely seminal: it spoke to a pent-up creative demand, and the idea that so many of us can be creators. Creative freedom is the great thing. Networks are always going to be hampered by commercial considerations. We\u2019re trying to build a world where we don\u2019t have to be constrained by that\u2026\u201d\n\nBailey and Barbato would continue to take that approach with WOW productions, including a contemporary array of independent docs on worldofwonder.net. Following Manhattan Cable, they also turned to public access-style Brit transmissions, including the offbeat live phone-in show Ring My Bell (1991, also hosted by Pike) and Takeover TV (1995), which featured fledgling broadcasters Adam Buxton and Graham Norton. Buxton would tell The Independent newspaper in 1995: \u201cPublic access will happen over here in five or 10 years, when people are completely comfortable with camcorders. It\u2019s just a different mentality in England.\u201d\n\nHyperlocal TV\n\nThe contrasting mindsets might be true, but Britain did already have a public access/community TV heritage, as documented by the London Community Video Archive, which has digitised programmes from the late 1960s onwards. LCVA co-founder, writer, filmmaker and academic Ed Webb-Ingall describes his fascination with these transmissions. \u201cI was trying to understand different forms of self-representation and image \u2013 and the origins, culturally and socially, as well as technologically,\u201d he says, pointing out that in the 1970s, various British regions \u2013 including the emerging \u2018new town\u2019 of Milton Keynes \u2013 had their own, hyperlocal cable TV networks. These often blended entertainment and social messages, as he explains: \u201cThey could use cable TV to communicate on a local community level, broadcasting public messages into people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nThe LCVA\u2019s collection of films is raw and resonant, offering perspectives rarely highlighted in mainstream programming, from immigrant experiences to portraits of black British youth, single mothers, and \u2018ordinary housewives\u2019 interviewed (one memorable black-and-white show, Things That Mother Never Told Us, opens with an impassioned folk serenade in \u201970s Milton Keynes)."}
