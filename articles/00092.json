In 2013, 18 people were executed - the highest figure in at least two decades, according to Amnesty International.\n\nOf those 18, 11 had been charged with drug-related offenses.\n\nAnalysis: Death penalty uncontroversial in anti-drug Singapore\n\nAnna Jones, BBC News, Singapore\n\nSingapore prides itself on its low crime rate and is fiercely anti-drugs, with a zero-tolerance approach to drug trafficking.\n\nUntil recently, drug trafficking was one of four crimes that brought a mandatory death sentence. Judges can now reduce that to life with caning, under certain conditions.\n\nThe government maintains that hanging drug traffickers sends a powerful message of deterrence against a socially destructive crime.\n\nHuman rights campaigners have long argued that the process is too secretive, and say that executions disproportionately target low-level drug mules, while doing little to stop the flow of drugs into the country.\n\nAmong Singaporeans, however, the use of the death penalty is largely uncontroversial.\n\nExecutions rarely get prominent coverage in the national media, and opinion polls consistently show overwhelming public support for the death penalty in some form, making the few anti-death penalty campaigners a fringe group.\n\nIn a country where the media is rarely overtly critical of government decisions, there is unlikely to be much of a public outcry over Punithan Genasan's fate being decided by video call.\n\nKirsten Han, a Singaporean journalist and activist, said: \"The delivering of a death sentence via Zoom just highlights how clinical and administrative capital punishment is.\"\n\nShe added that by bypassing a courtroom appearance, the accused's family had missed out on an opportunity to speak and hold hands with him.\n\nAmnesty International said the ruling was a \"reminder that Singapore continues to defy international law and standards by imposing the death penalty for drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the global attention is focused on saving and protecting lives in a pandemic, the pursuit of the death penalty is all the more abhorrent.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told the BBC: \"It's shocking the prosecutors and the court are so callous that they fail to see that a man facing capital punishment should have the right to be present in court to confront his accusers.\"\n\nSingapore officials are not the first to issue a death penalty over a video conference call.\n\nHuman Rights Watch condemned a similar ruling made in Nigeria earlier this month.\n\nLagos judge Mojisola Dada sentenced Olalekan Hameed to death by hanging for the murder of his employer's mother.\n\nHameed had pleaded not guilty to killing 76-year-old Jolasun Okunsanya in December 2018.\n\n\"The irreversible punishment is archaic, inherently cruel and inhuman. It should be abolished,\" Human Rights Watch told the BBC at the time."}
