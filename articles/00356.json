Warren/Associated Press\n\nPerhaps The Last Dance documentary that served as a refresher course for Michael Jordan's greatness can help the Chicago Bulls legend sell his home.\n\nAs Darren Rovell of Action Network noted, His Airness has attempted to sell his Chicago home for eight years. The home that was originally listed at $29 million is now listed at just less than $14.9 million:\n\nDan Gartland of Sports Illustrated noted the house that was first listed in February 2012 for $29 million failed to sell at auction in November 2013 with a minimum bid of $13 million.\n\nAccording to the Zillow listing, the 32,683-square-foot house has nine bedrooms and an astounding 19 bathrooms. It sits on a 56,000-square-foot property and features a regulation-sized basketball court, circular infinity pool, putting green, tennis court and cigar room.\n\nJordan's No. 23 is right on the front gate, and his logo is midcourt on the basketball floor.\n\nYou know, just in case an interested buyer forgot who owns the house."}
