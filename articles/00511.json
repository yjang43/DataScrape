International platforms like the 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair -- which, this year, is holding fairs in London and New York, in addition to February's Marrakesh event -- have helped find wider overseas audiences for photographers' work.\n\nCNN Style asked four of the African arts scene's most prominent figures to choose their favorite photographers. Here, the photographers explain, in their own words, what their work aims to explore.\n\nTokini Peterside, founder and director of Art x Lagos\n\nAs the founder and director of the international art fair, Art x Lagos, Tokini Peterside has helped amplify African artists' voice in the global market. She selected two Nigerian photographers, Kadara Enyeasi and Lakin Ogunbanwo.\n\n\"Madonna III\" by photographer Kadara Enyeasi.

My immediate elder sister (in a family of four siblings -- two elder sisters and a junior brother) had just begun her career as a model. She is now a fashion designer. I took pictures of her, and other family members, back then. It was a rush! Nothing special, just intimate family portraits with a 2-megapixel Nikon camera which I still happen to have in my possession.\n\n\"At first (my photography) was a deep yearning to understand my role in society. I engaged in taking performative self-portraits as a study of myself and orientation. This resulted in 'Human Encounters,' a body of work created over three years. It highlighted shapes, silhouettes and the interesting play of light and shadows across the human body.\n\n\"Forms (and) characters. A ladder placed askew on a wall. A forgotten shoe at the beach, a plastic bag moving in the wind. The poetics of these objects speak to me.\"\n\nNigerian photographer Lakin Ogunbanwo fuses fashion photography and portraiture in his work.

I'm usually drawn to form, interesting shapes and silhouettes.\"\n\nTouria El Glaoui, founder and director of 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair\n\nTouria El Glaoui is the creative force behind 1-54, an international art fair helping to introduce leading African artists to the global market. She spotlighted photographer Phumzile Khanyile.\n\n\"Plastic Crowns\" (2016) by Phumzile Khanyile.

My visual training started when I still couldn't read, and I relied on pictures to know what the story was about. We had a bookshelf at home that I would drown myself in, especially because I've always been a loner.\n\n\"I've always wanted to be a painter, and so with my photography I try to paint as much as the camera allows.\n\n\"As the world is moving towards Afrofuturism, I'm trying to hold on to the past as much as possible. I believe there are a lot of untouched stories that are being left behind. I'm actually inspired by the boring parts (of) life, I enjoy observing people, their mannerisms, the way they talk, the way they wait or smoke. These things help me build characters and stories in my head.\n\n\"I also create images purely from emotion. It has to feel right. Honesty ranks higher than technicality for me.\"\n\nHassan Hajjaj, Morocco: \"(What moves me to take photographs) are interesting people that inspire me and influence me. Color, travel, culture, textiles, music and life (draw my eye).\"\n\nHelen Jennings, editorial director and co-founder of Nataal magazine\n\nFounded in 2015, Nataal is a digital and print publication focused on contemporary African fashion, arts and culture. Co-founder and editorial director Helen Jennings chose to highlight visual artist Prince Gyasi.\n\nAn image by Prince Gyasi, who describes himself as a visual artist, rather than strictly a photographer.

She would drop me off at this photographer's small studio. I would always dress well, usually in my denim jacket and pants, because I knew he would take pictures of me with his camera. I'd follow him around the market just to see him photograph people, and anytime he didn't show up to work, I would cry.\n\n\"I had aspirations of becoming an abstract painter but found love in creating art with my iPhone.\n\n\"The city of Accra inspires me to keep creating. The people, the colors that make up the flag of Ghana inspire me to create more.\n\n\"As a co-founder of (the non-profit education organization) Boxed Kids, I will keep telling the stories of the kids in Jamestown and Ghana in general. People need to know about the culture and our story.\n\n\"I believe the norm is not for everyone. I'm different. I would rather people call me a visual artist. I do not want to be recognized as a photographer, but as an artist. Most of my images look like paintings from afar because they are art pieces, not photographs. I want to leave a legacy in the art world.\"\n\nMaheder Haileselassie Tadese, member of the Everyday Africa collective\n\nEveryday Africa is an art collective aiming to change perceptions about Africa. Its Instagram account posts images of daily life, which are submitted by photographers from across the continent. One of the collective's members, Maheder Haileselassie Tadese, spotlighted photographers Nana Kofi Acquah and Brian Otieno.\n\nA scene captured by photographer Nana Kofi Acquah.

I have a painting background and so I was quite shocked at how naturally I took to photography. With mastery of the craft came a desire to use it for more than just making pretty pictures. At this moment in my life, my photography is about telling important stories that help challenge and hopefully change perceptions (of) Africa.\n\n\"The camera immortalizes anything you point it at, and that is a knowledge that motivates me. If I can point my camera at the people, the issues and the stories I deem worthy, the world has no choice but to pay attention. And with that attention comes opportunity to challenge or change people's minds.\"\n\nAn image by Kenyan photographer Brian Otieno captures a young ballet dancer in Nairobi's Kibera slum. Credit: Brian Otieno\n\nBrian Otieno, Kenya: \"I started photography five years ago, photographing my neighborhood Kibera to share different stories rather than the usual dominant visual narrative of hopelessness and misery.\n\n\"I am drawn to the everyday life of the people around me. Their stories also represent my experiences as someone who was also born and grew up in (a) slum neighborhood. I photograph my people as someone who understands their successes and challenges.\"\n\nThe photographers' words have been edited for length and clarity."}
