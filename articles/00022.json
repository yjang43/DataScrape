In sync with the flickering light, there is a harsh clicking \u2013 a little like the tapping of an over-enthusiastic flamenco dancer with her castanets. But the rhythm isn\u2019t there to entertain, but to entrain.\n\nThe combination of the flashing light and clicking lights are designed to synchronise a particular type of electrical activity in the brain known as gamma waves.\n\nTo the uninitiated, this kind of light-and-sound bath may sound like the latest wellness fad \u2013 but Tsai is a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, USA. And she has evidence that this could provide protection against Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The part of my dad that dementia can\u2019t take\n\n\u2022 The link between herpes and Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\n\u2022 Why Alzheimer\u2019s hits women harder than men\n\nHer research represents a radical new approach to preventing and treating the most common form of dementia. Today, dementia affects around 50 million people worldwide \u2013 and by 2050, that figure is expected to triple."}
