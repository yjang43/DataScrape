Spain has reported almost 28,000 deaths and 232,000 infections since March but the rate of infection has declined.\n\nSpain had imposed some of the toughest measures on the continent, including keeping children indoors for six weeks. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez addressed parliament on Wednesday ahead of a vote on extending the state of alert for two more weeks.\n\nWhat does the law say?\n\nThe decree states: \"Using masks will be compulsory on the street, in open spaces and any closed place of public use, when it is not possible to maintain a safe distance of at least two metres (6.5ft).\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez wore a mask during a session of parliament on Wednesday\n\nWhile children under six are not required to wear masks, all between the ages of three and five are recommended to wear them. According to El Pa\u00eds, that means 45 million people will now have to wear a mask and another 1.3 million will be urged to.\n\nThe law underlines that it is following World Health Organization recommendations to minimise infection in closed and public places where there is a large concentration of people.\n\nIt says wearing masks is justified as it blocks the transmission of infected droplets in areas where safe distances cannot be guaranteed.\n\nYou are exempt if you have a respiratory illness or another health issue or disability that makes wearing a mask impossible.\n\nIn other words, people with asthma, allergies or forms of anxiety will not be liable. No penalties for breaking the law are mentioned and there is no specific type of mask detailed other than that it should cover both nose and mouth.\n\nAre face masks useful?\n\nBy Philippa Roxby, health reporter, BBC News\n\nFace masks or coverings are most useful to stop the person wearing them spreading the virus, particularly if they have any symptoms but also if they don't.\n\nThat's why many countries are now recommending people wear them on public transport and in shops, for example, where they can't stay 2m away from other people.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Everybody queuing in this market in Las Torres, near Burgos, was wearing a mask on Wednesday\n\nBut they are by no means fool-proof - if you touch them, if you wear them wrongly and if they are loose around the edges they can become contaminated. And they are not a replacement for washing hands frequently and social distancing.\n\nThey are also not thought to be as relevant when people are outdoors.\n\nThe World Health Organization says only two groups of people should wear masks - those who are unwell with symptoms and those caring for people suspected to have the virus. It also says medical masks - which are usually much tighter and better made - should be kept for healthcare workers, who are most in need.\n\nWhat do other countries say?\n\nThere is a wide array of measures across Europe:\n\nMost parts of Germany, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic say masks should be worn in shops and on public transport\n\nSlovakia and the Czech Republic are extending that rule to include offices too\n\nItaly says masks should be worn in shops and on transport but in public too where it is hard to maintain a safe distance\n\nThe UK, Switzerland and Belgium recommend the wearing of masks: face coverings are being advised for people in Scotland and England in certain enclosed spaces\n\nGreece says masks should be worn in shops, on transport, in enclosed spaces and by tour guides\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Would you wear this mask with an automatic eating hole?\n\nWhat do I need to know about the coronavirus?"}
