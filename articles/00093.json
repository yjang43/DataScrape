Mr Malpass said that 100 countries, home to 70% of the world's population, had already been granted emergency finance.\n\n\"While the World Bank is providing sizeable resources, it won't be enough,\" he added.Mr Malpass said he was also frustrated with commercial lenders dragging their heels on offering debt relief to poor nations. \"I have been somewhat frustrated by the slow pace. Commercial creditors are still, by and large, taking payments from even the poorest countries and there needs to be faster movement.\"\n\nThe World Bank worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a scheme to allow poorer countries to request debt relief on repayments of loans owed to G20 members until the end of this year.\n\nAt the same time, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan bank, said that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as a \"wake-up call\" to build a fairer society.\n\n\"It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long,\" he wrote ahead of the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday."}
