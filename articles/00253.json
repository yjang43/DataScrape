His focus is Formula 1 but he is still very much involved in the Formula E programme.\n\n\"What I try to do is the same as Toto, which is holistic. I'm passionate about racing and making sure we're always moving in the right direction. He does that very well.\n\n\"He'll leave us to it but he offers great advice when it comes to drivers or analyzing what went wrong at a race and what could have been done better.\"\n\nWolff v Wolff in Formula E\n\nIan James and Toto Wolff at the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team launch with the teams' drivers Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne.\n\nDespite Wolff's split interest and direction, James is adamant it will have no bearing on Lewis Hamilton or Mercedes' continued ambition to remain No.1 when the F1 season gets under way in Australia next month.\n\nBut the Austrian is not the only Wolff James has to deal with. Toto's wife Susie, team principal of the Venturi team , is a partner in using the Mercedes EQ powertrain but also a grid rival.\n\nJames laughs at the idea he might be caught in the midst of a Wolff vs. Wolff on-track battle. \"It's certainly a unique position to be in,\" he said. \"But it's great to have Susie on board as she's someone I can have a very open dialogue with.\n\n\"We know if we take the right approach and work collaboratively, we can develop both teams faster together. And it would be a dream if all four drivers are fighting for the top spots. Then it gets serious.\"\n\nPhotos: The 2019/20 Formula E season Mexico City, R4: Porsche's Andre Lotterer (right) led the field off the grid from pole in what was an incident filled Mexico E-Prix.

But he was also heavily involved in the powertrain development which led to the first world titles in 2014 and the ongoing dominance.\n\n\"I'm a jack of all trades, master of none,\" he said. \"I'm an engineer by trade but genuinely a bad one. I've had time in finance and marketing, in program management. It's been a mixed bag.\n\n\"And with this, I was lucky -- it was genuinely too good to turn down, not just getting back into motor sport which is a passion of mine but also the opportunity to start up a business.\"\n\nAnd like any motor sport business, the primary goal is winning.\n\n\"Internally, there's enough understanding and empathy that expectations are kept in check in our rookie year in a complex series,\" he said. \"But externally we're the team with the three-pointed star, one linked with great success in F1 and DTM before that.\n\n\"It takes time, look at F1 for example. But we want to win the competition as we're racers. The mid-term goal is to get into championship contention but we're aware how challenging that will be.\n\n\"Of all the things I've done, this will be very hard to top. We're at the start of this journey and making sure we bring the results and build up the business to make sure that it's ready for the future.\""}
