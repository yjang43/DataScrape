So, now we\u2019re dedicating a series to help you escape. We\u2019ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads.\n\nYou\u2019ll find everything from the story about the world\u2019s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us, the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life. What you won\u2019t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy.\n\nDogs seem almost biologically incapable of hiding their inner moods \u2013 shuffling, snuffling, tail-wagging clues to contentment, nervousness or sheer, unadorned joy. Despite what the famous painting might want to tell you, dogs would be terrible poker players. We pick up their cues all too easily.\n\nCats also have sophisticated body language \u2013 their moods are signalled through twitching tails, ruffled fur, and the position of ears and whiskers. A purr usually (but not always) signals friendliness or contentment. They\u2019re a usually reliable method of working out if the cat is in friendly mode or best left alone.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nWhile we can reasonably be sure of a dog\u2019s bond with us, despite the thousands of years domesticated cats have kept us company, they still suffer something of a bad PR image. The independence that many see as a bonus is seen by others as aloofness or selfishness. Their detractors claim they only really show affection when a food bowl is empty.\n\nCat owners will claim this is all nonsense, of course, and that their bond with their cat is as strong as any dog owner\u2019s. But why does this image of the aloof, unfriendly cat remain? And is there any truth to it?"}
