In Bangladesh, 8 million could be in its path, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.\n\nEvacuation efforts in India and Bangladesh are being complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, as relief teams grapple with how to get millions of people to safety while also protecting them against the risk of Covid-19."}
