To help provide insight on how to manage this, BBC Worklife is updating some of our most popular productivity stories from our archive. This article was first published on 9 July 2019.\n\nIn 2008 Annie Vernon rowed for Great Britain in the quad sculls at the Beijing Olympics. At 25, she was the youngest member of an experienced group that was set on becoming the first women\u2019s rowing team to win Olympic gold. In a close finish, they were beaten to first place by the Chinese. Vernon was devastated, and remains mentally scarred by the loss. In an interview to promote her book on the psychology of elite sport, Mind Games, she called it \u201cthe defining feature of my career\u201d.\n\nFor those of us who are not elite athletes, it is hard to understand quite how punishing the experience of a \u2018near miss\u2019 can be. Reaching the very top level of performance requires an immense mental effort, and when you care that much about winning, losing feels like cruel punishment.\n\nBut top athletes \u2013 and, it turns out, many others \u2013 have a way of turning pain into rocket fuel. The defeat becomes a reason to push themselves even further the next time.\n\nVernon recovered from her disappointment to win gold at the 2010 Rowing World Championships."}
