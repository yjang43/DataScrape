Come as you are, there are no reservations, we are open for everyone.\"\n\nThat's quite a turn from being perhaps the most difficult reservation to secure and paying hundreds of dollars to dine and drink (their most recent seafood menu cost around $580 including wine pairing).\n\nThe restaurant closed in mid-March because of the Covid-19 pandemic. As Denmark starts to reopen two months later, lucky Danes get a chance to have a new, albeit limited, Noma experience.\n\nNoma is no stranger to change -- founder Ren\u00e9 Redzepi closed the first version of the restaurant 14 years after opening to start again with Noma 2.0, which opened in 2018. In the interim, Redzepi has done pop-ups in Japan, Mexico, even one under a bridge in Copenhagen.\n\nThe agility of this restaurant and its team is one of its most singular attributes, as well as its bringing Nordic cuisine to the attention of gastronomes the world over.\n\nAfter opening the wine bar, Redzepi plans to reopen the original, new Noma in due time."}
