Amid the crisis, views on Instagram Live doubled in one week, Facebook reported a 70% increase in Messenger group video calls and WhatsApp has seen a 40% increase in usage.\n\n\u201cReaching for our phones is a common coping mechanism for the unknown,\u201d says Doreen Dodgen-Magee, an psychologist based in the US state of Oregon and the author of Deviced!: Balancing Life and Technology in a Digital World. \u201cWe stay connected to our screens and the news that they provide, hoping that it will help us feel less anxious.\u201d\n\nA few weeks before the coronavirus crisis gripped New York City, I had deleted Instagram. I was tired of mindlessly scrolling through the app while standing in the grocery store queue or waiting on the subway platform. After a week without the app, I realised I wasn\u2019t picking up my phone as frequently and it gave me a strange sense of freedom.\n\nThen lockdown began. I felt completely disconnected from the world, and desperately needed to see how everyone else was coping. I downloaded Instagram again. This time, though, the app felt less of a time-waster, and instead more purposeful \u2013 it was as though it was OK to be on my phone because I was unable to physically access people. I wanted to connect with my friends across the world to see how they were dealing with quarantine. I needed advice from celebrity chefs on using leftovers, and information on which brands were making and donating masks."}
